# Intelligent_Selfie_Stick

The Intelligent Selfie Stick is a smart selfie stick that could position the mobile device to take selfies at different angles. The project is an application of `Arduino` Micro–controller and its communication with the mobile device using `Bluetooth`. In order to make the project cost effective, materials from our day–to–day life were used. The project was selected for display at `Delhi Mini Maker Fair`.
