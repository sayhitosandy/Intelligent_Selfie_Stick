# Intelligent_Selfie_Stick

The Intelligent Selfie Stick is a smart selfie stick that could position the mobile device to take selfies at different angles. The project is an application of Arduino Micro–controller and its communication with the mobile device using Bluetooth. In order to make the project cost effective, materials from our day–to–day life were used. The project was selected for display at `Delhi Mini Maker Fair`.
